Spring Framework
----------------
Spring Framework is an open source Java platform that provides comprehensive
infrastructure support for developing robust Java applications very easily and rapidly

Dependency Injection 
--------------------
Spring is mostly identified with Dependency Injection which is flavor of
Inversion of Control (IoC)

Ex:
		class Employee
		{}
		class Department
		{
			Employee emp = new Employee();
		}

		Department dept = new Department();

	In the above code, dept object and emp object are tightly coupled

Ex:
		class Employee
		{}
		class Department
		{
			Employee emp;//property
			Department(Employee emp)//constructor injection
			{
				this.emp = emp;
			}
			void setEmp(Employee emp)//setter injection
			{
				this.emp = emp;
			}
		}

		Employee emp = new Employee();
		Department dept = new Department(emp);

		In the above code, emp object and dept object are loosely coupled

Life cycle of an Object
-----------------------
Object Creation -> Object Usage -> Object Destruction

In Java, Object Destruction is taken care by Java as Java is automatic garbage collection

In Spring, the life cycle of an object is taken care by Spring Framework

In Spring the objects are created using spring bean xml configuration file

Spring Modules
-------------
- Spring Core/Bean Module
- Spring DAO Module
		- Spring JDBC
		- Spring ORM (Hibernate)
		- Spring Data JPA(Java Persistence API)
- Spring MVC Module => used to develop web applications
- Spring Boot Module
- Spring REST Module

Developing a Spring Application in Eclipse using Maven
------------------------------------------------------
- Create a Maven Project
	Click on File -> New -> Maven Project

		Click Next

	In Catalog Select : Internal
	In Artifact Id Select : maven-archetype-quickstart

	Click Next

	Group Id : spring
	Artifact Id : SpringProj
	Package : com.spring

	and click Finish

- Add the following dependencies in pom.xml file of SpringProj

		<dependency>
    		<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    		<artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
    		<version>4.3.10.RELEASE</version>
		</dependency>

			REfer program pom.xml

- Create a spring bean class "Book" in com.spring package of src/main/java folder
  of SpringProj
		REfer program Book.java

- Create a Spring bean class "Library" in com.spring package
		Refer program Library.java

- Create Spring bean XML configuration file "library.xml" in src/main/java folder
		REfer program library.xml

- Create a Test class "LibraryTest" in com.spring package
		Refer program LibraryTest.java (Run)
