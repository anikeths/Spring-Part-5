Spring REST Module
------------------
Spring REST Module is used to create REST APIs

REST APIs are used to develop distributed applications which are used to interact
one application with another application

Spring Boot REST CRUD Application with POSTMAN Client
-----------------------------------------------------
Refer document Spring Boot REST CRUD Application with POSTMAN.docx

Refer source codes in SpringBootRESTCRUDProj.ZIP

Spring Data JPA Module (Java Persistence API)
----------------------
interface StudentDAO
{
   CRUD operations
}
public class StudentDAOImpl implements StudentDAO
{
  //implement interface methods
  //overridden CRUD operations
}
interface EmployeeDAO
{
  CRUD operations
}
public class EmployeDAOImpl implements EmployeeDAO
{
   ...
}

20 DAO interfaces => 20 DAO implementation classes

Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API) 
---------------
interface EmployeeDAO extends JPARepository<Employee,Integer>{}
interface StudentDAO extends JPARespository<Student,Integer>{}

Note: Hibernate is an implementation of JPA 

Spring DATA JPA methods
------------------------
- save()
- deleteById()
- findById() => primary key
- findAll()


Microservices
-------------
- Microservices is used to break up single large monolithic system into multiple
  independent components
- In Monolithic application all functionalities are part of single program
  running in a single environment
		Refer diagram Monolithic Application.png

- In Microserivices architecture the components are built and deployed independently
  to integrate into a single larger system
		Refer diagram Microservice Architecture.png


Netflix Eureka Server
---------------------
Netflix Eureka Server is used for building the service registry server and 
Eureka Clients which will register themselves and discover other services
to call REST APIs
